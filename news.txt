After a strike-free Sunday, the cabin crew union UFO is set to continue and extend its strike on Monday.
According to the union, the strike of the Lufthansa flight attendants will continue at Frankfurt airport, Germany's most important international hub, and Düsseldorf. The strike will also extend to Munich, an airport that was not affected by strikes on Friday and Saturday.
On Saturday, Lufthansa canceled about 520 flights from Frankfurt and Düsseldorf. According to Germany's flagship carrier, about 58,000 passengers were affected by the strike on Sunday - even more than on Friday, when 290 flights were canceled.
The cabin crew union UFO is planning to stage more walkouts until November 13 if Lufthansa's management does not make concessions. As a result, it could become the longest strike in the history
